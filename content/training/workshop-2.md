Data is everywhere today and for the Smart Manufacturing operation the ability to extract value from that data is essential. Python is an extremely popular choice when analyzing, exploring and visualizing data. The market for Data Scientists is [exploding](https://www.forbes.com/sites/louiscolumbus/2017/05/13/ibm-predicts-demand-for-data-scientists-will-soar-28-by-2020/#4d4149387e3b) so there is no better time to learn this invaluable skill set.

## Syllabus

### Day 1

The first day will be used to get everyone up to speed with the Python-specific tooling that is commonly used for data analytics. This tooling includes the [Jupyter ecosystem](http://jupyter.org/), but also exploring some challenging in-class manufacturing data problems with [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/), [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/).

### Day 2

We will set up a [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database using [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/). After that, we will use Python APIs to connect to various manufacturing-oriented data sources in order to extract insight and value from them. This is a great skill to learn since extracting value from data is what Data Science is all about!

### Day 3

This day is designed to focus on [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) which is a machine learning library for Python. If you are interested in practical or research applications of machine learning, this day is for you.
