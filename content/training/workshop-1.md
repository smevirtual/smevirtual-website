Python programming is on the rise! For the modern engineer, computer programming is a mandatory skill set when interacting with advanced manufacturing, robotics design, data analytics and machine learning. Python is an approachable language with a clean syntax and a vast collection of reusable libraries. Python is in [high demand](https://www.codingdojo.com/blog/7-most-in-demand-programming-languages-of-2018/) by employers so it is a great language to learn for both students, experienced professionals and everyone in between.

## Syllabus

### Day 1

This day is dedicated to introducing the basics of Python programming, managing Python packages, working with Python support tooling and getting your feet wet on some actual Python projects.

Topics covered will include:

- Data types.
- Packages and importing.
- Reading and writing data.
- Classes and objects.
- Control flow.
- Debugging.
- Testing.
- Code documentation.

### Day 2

We will explore the very powerful and popular [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) and [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) Python packages for performing numerical analysis and data visualization.

### Day 3

This last section will be all about a Python package called [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/). Pandas is great for data wrangling and data analysis and so we will work on some manufacturing-oriented data sets with it.
