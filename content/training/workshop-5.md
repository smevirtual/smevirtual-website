Industrial sensors and compact embedded systems are starting to become ubiquitous in the modern factory. These sensors are capable of measuring, capturing and analyzing all sorts of crucial data points within a production environment. Combined with the elastic nature of the Cloud, data analytics and machine learning, new levels of factory floor visibility is possible. The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is an integral part of the modern factory, but there are many moving parts. Learn-by-doing with actual IIoT hardware and the Cloud.
