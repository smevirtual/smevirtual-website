Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC) are a staple of manufacturing operations of every kind. PLCs are specialized industrial computers that control everything from a single robot to massive assembly lines and even entire plants. PLCs use a variety of programming languages - the most popular being [Ladder Diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmable_logic_controller#Programming_2). Understanding how PLCs work and how to interact with them is crucial for the modern manufacturing engineer and technical student.

## Syllabus

### Day 1

We will dive right in to how PLCs work, their major internal elements, their common industrial applications, safety guidelines and some common troubleshooting pointers. Participants will each be supplied with an actual PLC to interact with throughout the workshop.

### Day 2

This day will start with some preliminaries around reading PLC Ladder Diagrams. Afterwards, we will start learning how to program PLCs using Ladder Diagrams. Fundamental PLC instructions will be presented.

### Day 3

This day is a journey into more advanced PLC instructions, addressing and topics. HMI programming will be introduced and studied in detail.
