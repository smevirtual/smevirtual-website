## Contributing Guidelines

In general, only certain members of the SME Virtual Network leadership will be
permitted to create valid Pull Requests against this project. This is because
the SME Virtual Network is designed to be minimalist, introductory and will not
be updated that often with new information.

However, if you feel that something should be included on the website, please
feel free to open a [new issue](https://github.com/smevirtual/website/issues/new)
**before** starting any work. This way, the project maintainers and/or SME Virtual
Network leadership can evaluate your proposed scope of work without unduly
burdening your time. We will give definitive feedback on your issue.

Thank you for considering contributing to this project! Please review the
other projects in [our GitHub organization](https://github.com/smevirtual) for
more opportunities to contribute.
